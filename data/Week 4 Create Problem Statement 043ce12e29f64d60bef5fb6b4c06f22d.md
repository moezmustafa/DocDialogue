# Week 4 : Create Problem Statement

A problem statement is a clear description

of the user's needs that should be addressed.

## **Role of a Problem Statement :**

. Establish Goals 

. Understand the Constrains

. Define deliverables

. Create Benchmark for success

Problem Statement , It should be broad enough to

allow for some creative freedom,

but narrow enough that it can actually

be solved by a design solution.

[**Define a Hypotheses Statement :** ](Define%20a%20Hypotheses%20Statement%20245c60aaa3ba40e281702911253bae68.md)

Brainstorming solutions is similar to making

a hypothesis or an educated

guess about how to solve the problem.

In UX design, we write

possible solutions to the problem

as hypothesis statements.

It looks like this:

If (name an action),

then (name an outcome).

Let's go back to our earlier example with Amal.

Amal is an athlete who needs a way to sign up for

workout classes because the class he

wants to participate in fills up fast.

Your hypothesis statement might be something like this:

If Amal downloads the gym's app,

then he can reserve his favorite class in advance.

Like we said, hypothesis statements

don't have a standard formula.

Instead of using an if-then statement,

you could also write this hypothesis statement

as something more flexible.

Amal needs an app that allows

him to reserve his favorite classes in

advance and notifies him

of the first opportunity to sign up.

In both of these examples,

we are guessing, or hypothesizing,

what has to happen for Amal's need to be solved.
