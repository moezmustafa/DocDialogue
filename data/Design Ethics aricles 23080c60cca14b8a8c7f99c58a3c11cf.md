As a UX designer, you have a responsibility to approach your work ethically and to keep the user’s best interest in mind. The products you design will be a part of the users’ lives, but they should not:

- Consume or control the user.
- Promote addictive behaviors.
- Promote unhealthy relationships between the user and a device or an app.
- Take advantage of the user.

Instead, the products you design should give users a choice about the actions they *do* want to take while using your product. Remember, apps should engage users, but apps should also be honest about their intentions and goals. To learn more about ethical design, here are a few resources to check out:
