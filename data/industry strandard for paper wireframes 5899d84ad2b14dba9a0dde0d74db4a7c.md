It’s the moment you’ve been waiting for: You’re ready to put pen-to-paper and begin to draw your dedicated mobile app focused on driving social good! It's time to create **wireframes**, which are outlines or sketches of a product or a screen. UX designers usually start creating paper wireframes first, then move to digital wireframes later.

Remember, wireframes help establish the basic layout of a screen. A **layout** is the structure that supports how visual components on a page are arranged, like images, text, and icons. Because paper wireframes are inexpensive and easy to create, you can draw multiple wireframes for the same screen of an app or website to explore a bunch of design possibilities.

Keep in mind that there are **industry standards**, or common ways to indicate page elements, that can make your wireframes easily understandable by other UXers. Use industry standards in your paper wireframes, such as:

- Horizontal lines to symbolize text
- Squares with an “X” overlapping the square to symbolize icons and images
- Circles and rectangles to symbolize call-to-action buttons
