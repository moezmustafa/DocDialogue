# Exampler :

The more your KPIs inform your research goals, the more you’ll be able to design for your end user. Ultimately, KPIs are an accountability tool to evaluate whether you’re addressing the problem you set out to solve in the first place!

Here is a completed exemplar along with an explanation of how the exemplar fulfills the expectations for the previous activity.

This is an exemplar using the CoffeeHouse scenario we have been following in this course. Below is an example UX research study plan with the KPI section filled out:

In this exemplar, the UX research study plan clearly identifies KPIs that are relevant to the project’s research goals:

- **Time on task**: How long it takes a user to complete a task
- **User error rates**: How often users make mistakes
- **Conversion rates**: The number of users who reach their goal successfully

The KPIs in the exemplar apply to the CoffeeHouse scenario because they:

- Show how long it takes users to make an individual order and a group order. Using the time on task KPI provides insight into whether the app speeds up group ordering or not.
- Show how often users get lost or make mistakes while making an order. Learning how users navigate and where they get stuck using the user error rates KPI will provide feedback about common sticking points in the design and places that need improvement.
- Show how many users successfully complete their group order. Seeing how many users are able to successfully order using the conversation rate KPI will provide feedback on whether the current checkout process is effective.

These KPIs can be looked at by themselves or combined with other KPIs. The more you find overlapping feedback between KPIs, the more you can identify different insights. For example, if time on task is high, user error rates are high, and conversion rates are low, that is a sign that the current process for group orders is difficult and inefficient for users, causing them to feel frustrated and stop using the product altogether. This kind of feedback is valuable for assessing how well your current design meets the project goal.

Take a look at your work. Have you chosen KPIs that:

- **Measure progress** toward a research goal?
- **Reveal meaningful insights** into user behavior?
- **Provide actionable feedback** about how the design is performing?

If you answered “yes” to each question, great job! It can sometimes be difficult to understand how KPIs apply to your research, but once you apply them they allow you to meet your goals more confidently.

If you didn’t answer “yes” to any of these questions, those are areas where you can refine your KPI selection process. Go back and choose new KPIs with the three questions above in mind.
