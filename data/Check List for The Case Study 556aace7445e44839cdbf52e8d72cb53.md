# Learn more about creating a case study for your portfolio project

---

You've finished the final designs for the mobile app you've been working on for the past few courses. Congratulations! What a great feeling. Now, you're ready to showcase your designs to future employers and other designers by creating a case study in your portfolio website. Your case study should include these ten things.

State your role in the project. In the real world, you'll mention the team members who collaborated on a design project with you and list the role that each of you played in bringing the designs to life. But for your project in this course, you covered the design process from beginning to end on your own! You should express that in the case study you're creating.

Outline your design process and the decisions you made that contributed to that design. This is a good place to back your decisions with data from any research findings or results of a usability study that informed your design thinking.

Show visuals of your design. This includes paper sketches, wireframes, and low-fidelity prototypes of your design.

Discuss the results of user testing. At this point, you want to help others understand why the issues occurred and what the usability tests showed as a result. In other words, what did you learn?

Showcase your design. You’ll include a mockup or high-fidelity prototype of your design here to wow your audience.

State your conclusion and possible next steps. This is your chance to talk about what you learned throughout the design process and to touch on the future direction for the product or possible iterations.

## Update your portfolio

You began creating your portfolio in the first course of this certificate, and hopefully you’ve been revising it along the way, as you created new assets and completed important hands-on activities. One of the biggest things you should keep in mind as you create your case studies is showing potential employers how you learned and adapted through the iteration of your design. Employers value a UX designer's ability to manage the input from stakeholders or users.
