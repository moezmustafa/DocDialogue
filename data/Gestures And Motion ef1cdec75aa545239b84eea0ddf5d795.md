## Gestures

**Gestures** are any method of interaction a user has with information on their device using touch. A few common gestures that you can use as a UX designer are:

- **Swipe.** A swipe is a brief brushing of the screen with a fingertip horizontally or vertically. A swipe can be used to move from one screen of an app to another. It can also be used to interact with a carousel of content.
- **Tap.** A tap is a brief touch of the screen by the user (not to be confused with a longer “press” or “touch and hold”). Taps can be customized from the use of one fingertip to four fingertips. Single-finger tapping is often used to select an item on the screen. Two-finger tapping is often used as a shortcut to make the context menu (also known as the right-click menu) appear.
- **Scroll and pan.** The scroll and pan gesture allows users to slide their fingers vertically, horizontally, and omnidirectionally through a page’s content. Scroll and pan works well for interactive features like maps or large collections of content like a gallery of images.
- **Drag.** The drag gesture provides users the ability to slide across the surface of a device to move it in and out of view. Drag is often used for the main notification menu on mobile devices.
- **Pinch.** Using two fingers simultaneously, a pinch is the movement of fingers closing into each other or moving away from one another. A pinch allows users to scale items on a screen like changing the size of a website. It is also used to zoom in and out of maps and photos.

Motion : 

Motion is a way to automate static design elements to focus the user's attention and

tell stories.

Another way to think about this is motion helps the user understand subtle changes

that take place on screen by adding an animation

Turning the page of the book in a swipe can be defined in these terms and in this example 

the swipe is the gesture and the animation of the page turn is the motion that actaullay adds 

upto this definition.
