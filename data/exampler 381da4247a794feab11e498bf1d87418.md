Above is the raw data from the usability study for the website.

To get our map started, the first thing we are going to do is put all of these observations into cards (sticky notes). We created the affinity mapping cards using Jamboard.

speaks in an indifferent tone: 1/5 participants
speaks in a frustrated tone: 3/5 participants
speaks in a confident tone: 2/5 participants
speaks in an annoyed or impatient tone: 2/5 participants

As you can see in the image above, we now have all of our observations laid out on our map. The cards are divided into colors that match the three types of observations in the note-taking spreadsheet:

1. RED: Opinion of the Shopping Experience and Website Overall
2. BLUE: Completing Prompts, for Ordering and Checkout
3. GREEN: Attitude About the Website and Completing Prompts

The formatting for the cards is the same in this case. At the top of the card, we have the observation and on the bottom, we have how many users shared that observation.

Now we are able to identify themes based on how many users shared the same observation. By doing this, we will be able to see what the most shared observations are among our users. For example, the same number of participants—4 out of 5—seemed to have trouble with entering or editing billing and shipping information AND modifying items in the cart. Also, 2 out of 5 participants had trouble completing an order before checkout AND entering payment information. This could indicate an issue with the overall checkout flow. To keep track of the themes we identified, we enter them into the **Insight Identification Template**.

Based on the theme that: Once at the checkout screen, users don’t have a way to edit the quantity of the items in the cart, an insight is: Add “+” and in “-” buttons to allow for the ability to edit quantity.

Based on the theme that: Users can’t easily copy the shipping address information into the billing info field, an insight is: Add a checkbox to allow use of the same address for billing and shipping.

Based on the theme that: During the checkout process, there isn’t a clear way for users to log in to their account to pre-fill previous billing and shipping info, an insight is: Prompt users to log into their account if they have one.

Since all three of our insights included elements that were either difficult to access or made it difficult for users to complete the task, we labeled all three as P0.

From here, we were able to come up with a clear action plan:

1. Add + and - buttons to allow for the ability to edit quantity.
2. Add a check box to allow users to use the same address for billing and shipping.
3. Prompt users to log in to their account if they have one.

Here’s what we did to review, analyze and synthesize the data from our usability study:

Step 1: We compiled all the raw data from the note-taking spreadsheet.

Step 2: We used Jamboard to do affinity mapping. This helped us divide the data into three categories: Opinion of checkout process & app overall, Completing prompts, and Attitude about the app and completing prompts.

Step 3: We created a digital note for each response, based on the colors used in the spreadsheet: red, blue, and green. We listed the type of observation and how many participants matched each observation.

Step 4: We analyzed the data to explore patterns and identified themes.

Step 5: Based on those themes, we came up with three insights to take action on. We’ll use these insights to go back to the high-fidelity prototype and continue to iterate on the design. Then we can decide if we want to prepare for another round of testing.

Now compare the exemplar above to your completed deliverable. Self-assess what you’ve done using each of the criteria used here to evaluate the exemplar.

What did you do well? Where can you improve? Take this feedback with you as you continue to progress through the course.
