# Learn more about How Might We and Crazy Eights

---

You’re in the middle of the ideation phase of the design process. Ideation is critical in your role as a UX designer, in order to come up with lots of design solutions for the problems that users are experiencing.

One way to generate ideas is by conducting a competitive audit, which you just completed. Now, you’ll use design thinking activities, like How Might We and Crazy Eights, to get your ideas flowing.

As a reminder, **How Might We** (HMW) helps you reframe a problem statement into questions that prompt you to come up with ideas for design solutions. If you want to learn more about HMW, revisit this video about [using How Might We to ideate](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/lecture/DNkpy/use-how-might-we-to-ideate) and this reading about [best practices for HMW](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/supplement/DjbCy/best-practices-for-how-might-we) from earlier in the certificate program. You can also check out Stanford University d.school’s tips on [How Might We questions](http://crowdresearch.stanford.edu/w/img_auth.php/f/ff/How_might_we.pdf).

In addition, with the **Crazy Eights** activity, you sketch ideas for eight different designs, each with a new idea for solving the user's problem.
