# Create a StoryBoard :

Storyboards are the , templates that are created by the user and they have following components 

. Character  ( the user ) 

. Scene        ( The environment in which user might uses the app ) 

. Plot           (Benefit of the Solution )

. Narrative   ( The user's need and how the solution will solve it )

And that’s it! Check out the completed big picture storyboard for this example:

Scenario: An app that allows users to recruit qualifies, new, or substitute musicians to join their band. 

1. The drummer in Dan's band quite so he needs to find a replacement.
2. Dan finds and opens the app.
3. Dan scrolls through the app and finds an experienced drummer who lives nearby. 
4. A former band member did not have experience with rock music so having relevant experience is important. 
5. Dan selects a drummer and taps submit to schedule an interview.
6. Dan is happy and his band schedules several gigs.

You brought the user, Dan, on a journey to find a new drummer for his band. You’ve addressed his pain points and helped him find a qualified drummer. Your user is delighted with the app experience. Big picture storyboards can really help immerse you in the experience of a user, which leads to better products overall.

## Create a close-up storyboard

To create a close-up storyboard, steps 1-4 are the same as the big picture storyboard process:

1. Start with a problem statement.
2. Create a goal statement.
3. Set up the storyboard.
4. Add the storyboard scenario.

**5. Draw one idea per panel.** Big picture storyboards and close-up storyboards differ in step five, when you draw each panel. Remember, big picture storyboards focus on the *user*, while close-up storyboards focus on the *product*. For this close-up storyboard, think about which product details you want to draw attention to on each panel and why. You want to demonstrate the user flow within the product and how each action within the product will lead to the next screen.

- To begin, in the **first panel**, the user will open their phone, swipe through their apps, and tap the icon for the musician app to open it.
- Oftentimes when designing an app, one panel of a close-up storyboard will focus on how a user begins their journey when they first open the app. For this example of the app to find musicians, let’s imagine that a new user can create a profile or an existing user can log in. This is shown in the **second panel**.
- In the **third panel**, once the user is logged into the app, they can begin searching for their bandmate. The user scrolls through profiles of musicians and can set filters like level of experience, years played, location, instruments played, and more.
- In the **fourth panel**, the user taps the “view profile” button of one of the musicians to review their experience, qualifications, and location.
- Then, once the user finds a candidate they’re interested in contacting, they tap the “submit” button to send a message to that musician. The user can write their own message or send an automated message that asks about availability and to schedule a conversation. There’s also an option for the user to provide a sample of their music to the musician. This is shown in the **fifth panel**.
- Finally, in the **sixth panel,** the user receives a confirmation that their message has been sent and a description of the next steps to expect. The text below the confirmation might say something like, “Your message to this musician has been sent.” There will also be a button linking back to the user’s inbox and one that leads them back to the search page they just came from.

Scenario: An app that allows users to recruit qualifies, new, or substitute musicians to join their band. 

1. user finds musician app and tapes the icon to open the app
2. new user create profile or existing user logs in 
3. user scrolls through musician profiles to search for qualified candidates and sets filters.
4. user selects "view profile" to review musician's experience, qualifications, location, etc. 
5. user selects the "submit" button to send a message to a specific musician 
6. user receives confirmation that message was sent and expected next steps.

That’s it! You now know how to create a big picture and a close-up storyboard. In the next activity, you’ll have an opportunity to
