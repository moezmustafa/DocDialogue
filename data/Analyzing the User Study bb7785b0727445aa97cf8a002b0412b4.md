# Analyzing the User Study

# Learn more about analyzing and synthesizing research results

---

Congratulations on conducting a usability study to gather feedback about your low-fidelity prototype! Were you able to learn anything about the responsive website designs you’ve created?

Now that you have a ton of feedback from research participants, you’ll need to gather, organize, and synthesize the research results in order to come up with strong insights that’ll help you improve your product.

As you might remember from an earlier course in the certificate program, you can follow four simple steps to turn the observations from research into actionable insights:

- Gather the data in one place
- Organize the data
- Find themes
- Come up with insights

If you’d like to learn more, there are some great resources from earlier in the certificate program you can reference. First, review this video about [turning observations into insights](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/h2sLN/developing-insights) to recall the four steps at a high level. Then, check out videos that describe each of the steps in detail:

- [Gather the data in one place and organize the data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/SgLb3/gather-and-organize-data) with affinity diagrams. You can also check out the reading that follows the video, which dives deep into [creating affinity diagrams](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/supplement/5FfQh/learn-more-about-creating-affinity-diagrams) to organize data.
- [Find patterns and themes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/e8nfr/patterns-and-themes-in-research-data) in research data.
- Come up with insights, keeping these [qualities of strong insights](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/51JCS/qualities-of-strong-insights) in mind.
