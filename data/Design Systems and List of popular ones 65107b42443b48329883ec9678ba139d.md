A **design system** is a series of reusable elements and guidelines that allow teams to design and develop a product, following predetermined standards. Design systems include all kinds of elements from color palettes to icons to buttons. Design systems create consistency for both designers and users, and make designing faster and easier.

To learn more about using design systems in mockups, review this video that provides an [introduction to design systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/item/Y8IFm) and this video about [the benefits of design systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/nhIQi/benefits-of-design-systems) from an earlier course of the certificate program.

As you create mockups, you might develop your own design system or utilize an existing design system.

## Develop your own design system

Using the **Assets Panel** in Adobe XD to save colors, character styles, and components allows you to develop your own small-scale design system with ease. You’ve been adding to the Assets Panel throughout this course as you created mockups, so you’ve been developing a design system without even knowing it! Check out this video from the Adobe blog if you’d like to learn more about [how to share design systems with Creative Cloud libraries](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/learn/design-systems/cloud-libraries/share-design-systems-with-creative-cloud-libraries.html) or this guide to [working with Creative Cloud libraries in Adobe XD](https://letsxd.com/guides/creative-cloud-libraries) from Let’s XD.

If you’re designing in Figma for the project in this course, instead of Adobe XD, you can create a simple design system called a **sticker sheet**. A sticker sheet is basically a frame within Figma where you save colors and components that you can copy-and-paste into designs. Revisit this video from earlier in the certificate program if you’d like to learn more about [creating a sticker sheet in Figma](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/Q36KK/create-a-sticker-sheet-in-figma).

## Utilize an existing design system

As a UX designer, you’ll utilize design systems all the time to improve the speed and consistency of your work. Especially when you’re new to the field, design systems can help you get a feel for best practices in design and can improve the quality of your work. Check out this reading from earlier in the certificate program that [lists popular design systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/FuNQY/explore-popular-design-systems), like Google, Apple, and Microsoft, that you can consider utilizing in your own projects.

You can also explore **user interface (UI) kits**, which are a collection of elements, components, and files that help UX designers create apps and websites. In other words, UI kits include a bunch of design components that you don’t need to create yourself, like typography and icons. UI kits are like simplified design systems. Check out this [list of UI kits](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/features/ui-kits.html) for Adobe XD that you can download and use in your own designs.
