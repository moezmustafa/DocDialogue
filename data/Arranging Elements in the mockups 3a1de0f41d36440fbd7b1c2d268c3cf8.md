# Arranging Elements in the mockups

# Review arranging elements in mockups

---

You’ll need more than just the foundational elements of visual design - typography, color, and iconography - to create successful designs! UX designers also often start by focusing on three methods to arrange elements in designs: grids, containment, and negative space. Think of these methods as rules used to create order for foundational elements.

First, you need to plan the **layout** of your mockups, which are ways to arrange elements on a page. The goal of layouts is to present information in a logical way, making the important elements stand out. You learned about common website layouts earlier in the certificate program, including single and multi-column layouts, the grid of cards layout, featured image layout, and more. If you need a refresher, watch this video about [common website layouts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/lecture/xsNJK/explore-common-layouts-for-website-home-pages) or this reading with [examples of common website layouts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/supplement/wb6Qy/learn-more-about-common-website-layouts).

To create an effective layout, you can utilize grids. Remember, **grids** are lines that are evenly spaced to help you design consistently and manage spacing of elements. If you’ve been designing your responsive website in Figma, check out this video about [using grids to guide layouts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/xGyD7/use-grids-to-guide-layouts) and this reading about [creating grids in Figma](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/U8TTJ/create-grids-in-your-mockups) to learn more. Or, if you’re designing in Adobe XD, review this video about [creating wireframes in Adobe XD](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/lecture/RcLtk/create-digital-wireframes-in-adobe-xd) where grids are discussed.

As you create mockups, it’s also important to think about the way the elements are contained. **Containment** uses visual barriers to keep designs neat and organized. There are four common methods of containment:

- **Dividers**: Single lines to separate sections of a page.
- **Borders**: Continuous lines that often form shapes, like squares or rectangles, to break up sections of a page.
- **Fill**: Assign colors to borders and shapes.
- **Shadows**: Create dimension in combination with borders or fill.

If you’d like to learn more about using containment in your mockups, check out this video from an earlier course of the program about [using containment in layouts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/B2MWE/use-containment-in-layouts).

Finally, as you determine how to arrange elements in your mockups, you will need to consider the use of negative space. Remember, **negative space** is the area that surrounds an object within an image. It’s the gaps between the elements in the design or the space that’s not being used. To learn more about negative space, review this video about [using negative space in layouts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/an77h/use-negative-white-space-in-layouts) and this reading about [using negative space](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/kxQ6S/use-negative-white-space-in-your-mockups) from the previous course of the program.
