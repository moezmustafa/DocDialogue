Pro-tip number 2: 

Tell a story.

Your website could easily turn

into a list of links and photos,

but to engage your audience,

you need to tell a story about

your design process with a beginning, middle, and end.

This might mean that you start with

an introduction of the design problem.

Then in the middle, show the process you

followed to complete the designs,

like user research, sketches, and wireframes.

Then end with an image of the polished design,

and an endorsement from your client

or another person whose opinion you value.
