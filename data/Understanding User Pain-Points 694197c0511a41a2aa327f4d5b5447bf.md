# Understanding User Pain-Points :

## Preface :

You need to do research to get into

the user's head and understand where they're coming from.

You also have to anticipate both the needs that users

know they have and the needs they don't know they have.

That's weird, right? How do users not know what they need?

Well, here's an example.

In the heyday of flip phones,

customers might have thought they

needed a longer battery life,

a bigger interface, an easier way to text.

But they had no idea they needed smartphones.

Most of us didn't even know smartphones were possible.

So when Apple introduced

the first modernized smartphone in 2007,

we were dazzled by all it could do.

Having a smartphone quickly turned

into a need for so many of us.

## Pain Points  :

Most pain points fall into one of four categories.

Financial pain points are user problems related to,

you guessed it, money.

If you've ever gotten lost in an online article,

only to be rudely interrupted by a paywall,

you know all about these.

There are also product pain points.

These are usually quality issues related to the product.

Norman Doors fall into this category.

Next up, there are process pain points.

These are frustrations that stop

the user going from point A to point B.

For example, have you ever shopped online and

struggled to get the item you want to check out?

That's a process pain point,

and that could mean the business loses a customer.

And finally, there are support pain points.

When users interact with your product,

they might have questions.

If they can't find answers to their questions,

they won't feel supported.

Customer service information that's hidden

on a website falls into this category.

Remember when I said designers need to read minds?

Well, we also need to read hearts.
