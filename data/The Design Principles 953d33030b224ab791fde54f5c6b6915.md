Emphasis: One large circle at the top and three small circles below it. 
Hierarchy: Shows the top lines as the largest and brightest and most important and the lines that follow become less and less important.
Scale: Shows two of the same yellow circles, the circle to the left is large and the circle to the right is scaled down.
Proportion: Three green circles, large, medium, and small that get smaller at the same proportions. 
Unity: Several small circles organized together that they show the shape of a four-sided star. 
Variety: Several different shapes in the same size and color.

In the previous two courses of the certificate program, you refined and improved your mockups using visual design principles like emphasis, hierarchy, scale, proportion, unity, and variety. If any of these terms are unfamiliar, return to an earlier course of the program, [Create high-fidelity designs and prototypes in Figma](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/home/week/2), and review Week 2, which is all about applying visual design principles to mockups.

Or, if want a quick refresher about visual design principles, check out these videos and readings from that course:
