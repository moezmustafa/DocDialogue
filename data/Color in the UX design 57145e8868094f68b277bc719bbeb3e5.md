# Color in the UX design

60 - 30 - 10 rule

One common rule that UX designers

use is the 60-30-10 rule.

One neutral color makes up

60 percent of the color palette in your design.

A second complementary color

makes up 30 percent of the palette.

A third accent color makes up

10 percent of the palette to add emphasis.

In our dog walker app,

we might use white as

60 percent of the color in the design,

gray as 30 percent,

and orange as 10 percent.

Accent colors, like orange in our case,

can be used to emphasize or highlight information, whereas

neutral colors play a supportive role

in backgrounds, lines, and text.

Let's pull up our dog walker app in Figma and

apply the 60-30-10 rule to the homepage.

The last time we worked on the homepage,

we added a line of text that said,

"Busy afternoon? We can take them for a walk."

Let's make this text stand out more by

placing a gray rectangle around the text.
