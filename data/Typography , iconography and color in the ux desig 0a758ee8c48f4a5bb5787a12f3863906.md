# Typography , iconography and color in the ux design

# Review foundational elements of visual design

---

You’ve put in so much hard work to create wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes for the dedicated mobile app portion of your final project. Now, you’re ready to move into creating mockups.

As a reminder, **mockups** are static, high-fidelity designs used as a representation of a final product. As you transition from digital wireframes to mockups, keep in mind that your designs can change greatly at this point in the process. For example, it’s totally okay to place an image, icon, or text in a different part of a mockup than you planned for in a wireframe. Going from a wireframe to a mockup should not feel like a direct copy/paste exercise, so think critically!

As you begin to design mockups, remember the importance of the foundational elements of visual design. On a basic level, the term **visual design** in UX refers to how a product or technology appears to the user. If you’ve been taking the courses of the certificate program in order, then you know all about three foundational elements of visual design: typography, color, and iconography.

We won’t cover these foundational elements in this final course of the program because we assume that you learned about them in previous courses. If you need a refresher, check out this video that [introduces the foundational elements of visual design.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/5PiMP/introduction-to-foundational-elements-of-visual-design) After that, revisit videos and readings that detail each of the three foundational elements of visual design that were covered, including:

- **Typography**: Review this video about [typography in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/KuESU/typography-in-ux-design), this video about [the importance of typography](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/Gc8PR/the-importance-of-typography), and this reading about [working with type in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/Tx6oY/work-with-type-in-mockups).
- **Color**: Review this video about [using color in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/t5ss3/color-in-ux-design), this reading about [working with color in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/MDi11/work-with-color-in-mockups), and this reading about [accessibility considerations for using color in design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/Ca3gb/accessibility-considerations-for-color).
- **Iconography**: Review this video about [iconography in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/item/oyuBk) and this reading about [working with icons in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/t1b2M/work-with-icons-in-mockups).

If this information is unfamiliar, you can return to complete Course 5 of the program: [Create high-fidelity designs and prototypes in Figma](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/home/welcome). Remember, we recommend that you complete the courses of this certificate program in sequential order so that you can effectively complete your design projects, learn the information required to successfully land a job as an entry-level UX designer, and benefit from the optimal user experience!
