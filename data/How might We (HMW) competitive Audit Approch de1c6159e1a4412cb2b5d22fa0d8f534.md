## Frame HMW questions

To create good HMW questions, you need a well-defined problem statement. From there, you can reframe this problem statement into questions that will help you come up with ideas to solve the problem.

Consider this problem that a user, Darren, faces: Darren is a concert goer who needs to keep track of their concert ticket because they need the ticket when they go through security.

Let’s revisit those useful tips from the Stanford University design school that you learned about in the video. These tips will help you reframe the problem from different angles.

## Best practices for thinking of HMWs

Coming up with good HMWs takes a little practice, but you’ll get the hang of it in no time! To start your ideation process on the right track, here are some best practices to keep in mind:

- **Be broad**. A good HMW should allow for multiple solutions. For example, one of the earlier questions, *How might we make keeping track of tickets fun and competitive?,* can be answered in countless ways.
- **But don’t be too broad**. You want your HMWs to be comprehensive, but narrow enough to keep your solutions focused. An example of a HMW question that is too broad is: *How might we make ticketing better?* This HMW doesn’t provide clear enough guidance to come up with ideas for solutions.
- **Make multiple drafts**. It’s okay to change your HMW questions after you’ve written them. If you find that your HMW doesn’t help you think of any useful solutions, change it up!
- **Be creative**. HMWs are meant to be imaginative and even fun. You can use the list of tips from Stanford above to think of new, creative ways to frame your questions.
- **Write as many HMWs as you can**. The more HMWs you have, the more solutions you can come up with. If you can make more than one question out of the frameworks you’ve learned, then go for it!

Now, you’re ready to come up with your own HMW questions for the app you’re going to design. HMWs are a great way to start thinking of potential solutions during the ideate stage of the design process. Good luck, and get creative!
