# Types Of Avoid deceptive patterns

Have you ever checked the box in an app for a free trial, assuming there were no strings attached, only to find out later that your credit card was charged? And even worse, there wasn’t an easy way to cancel the membership? Or perhaps you’ve signed up for a newsletter only to realize after you clicked “Submit” that you’d also agreed to sign up for multiple “related” newsletters. It happens to everyone!

These experiences are examples of deceptive patterns. Deceptive patterns trick users into unintentionally completing an action online. Deceptive patterns can include a range of visual, interactive, audio, or motion elements that are added to designs to deceive users.

Although the term “dark patterns” is often used in the industry, at Google and at other places, designers often use the phrase “deceptive patterns” to avoid referring to something problematic as “dark” and potentially “bad.” Instead, the word “deceptive” focuses on the tactic itself that tricks users into doing or buying something they wouldn’t have otherwise done or bought.

Deceptive patterns were first exposed in 2010 by UX designer Harry Brignull. He listed 11 types of patterns; some of the patterns overlap with the ones discussed in the video. Let’s take a closer look at some common deceptive patterns you might encounter in your work as a UX designer.

**Bait and switch:** A user wants to take an action that results in a specific outcome, but ends up with an unplanned result.

An example of bait and switch is asking a user for their email address, then using that information for a purpose they didn’t agree to. To avoid this in your designs, always be upfront with users about why you need their information, and be clear about what the user will get in return.

**Disguised ads**: Ads hidden in the page and made to look as if they were a part of the regular content or navigation.

Have you ever clicked what appeared to be a download button, but it was actually an ad that had popped up instead? This is an example of a disguised ad because you unintentionally clicked on the ad instead of the download you wanted.

**Forced continuity**: The practice of charging a user for a membership without a warning or a reminder.

Think back to the scenario from the beginning of this reading: a user clicks a box on an app thinking they’re getting a free trial with no strings attached, only to find out later that their credit card was charged, and there’s no easy way to cancel the membership. As a UX designer, be upfront and transparent with users.

- Notify users before their free trial ends and before they are charged.
- Make it easy for users to cancel their membership. Don’t make users search for the steps to cancel.
- Provide a link to take users through the cancellation process.
- Make sure the visual elements in your designs, like buttons, are labeled clearly.

**Friend spam:** When a product asks for access to a user’s social media account or contacts, seemingly to help users find friends on the app, but then uses that information to spam the user’s contacts with messages that appear to be from the user.

You may have encountered a social media app that made it difficult to use part of their service unless you allowed the app to access your contacts from your phone’s address book. To avoid friend spam, if you’re going to ask a user for access to their contacts, make sure they know why you’re asking for it and make it easy for them to opt out.

**Hidden costs**: Hidden or unexpected charges in the user’s cart that are not revealed until the end of the checkout process.

An example of the hidden costs deceptive pattern is when a user thinks that they’re paying a specific amount for a product or service, but at the end of checkout, they find out there are additional fees. Apps and websites add these hidden costs hoping that users will be too tired to find another site with cheaper products and unwilling to go through the entire checkout process again elsewhere.

In your own designs, be sure to give users all pricing related information upfront. A good way to avoid hidden costs is to make a calculator available during shopping where the user can calculate extra costs, like shipping and taxes, before checking out.

**Misdirection**: Trying to confuse the user so they’re unsure of which choice to make.

Misdirection often comes into play when wording is confusing and unclear. For example, imagine a newsletter that asks a user in a pop up “Are you sure you want to unsubscribe?” and then the text on the button says “No, cancel me.” It’s hard to know what this button means!

A good way to avoid this deceptive pattern in your own work is to make the header’s popup match the action on the button. For example, the header might say “Do you want to unsubscribe?” and the button would say “Yes” or “Unsubscribe.” As a rule of thumb, allow users to answer the questions they’re being asked directly, and don’t mix response categories.

**Price comparison prevention**: Making it intentionally difficult to compare prices so the user can’t make the best decision for themselves.

Price comparison prevention commonly happens when a company offers various subscription plans and the services for each are bundled, making it difficult to discern the individual costs of each item. The solution to this deceptive pattern is to make sure that pricing is upfront and clear. Users should be able to tell if it’s a better deal to purchase services separately or as part of the bundle.

**Trap door:** Designs that make it easy to trap users in an unwanted situation and make it hard for them to get out of that situation.

This deceptive pattern often happens when a user signs up for a subscription that is difficult to cancel. Imagine if you had to print a form, sign it, and send it in by mail in order to cancel a subscription. To avoid the trap door in your work, make it simple for users to make decisions, and clearly give users the information they need without complicating the process.

**Sneak into basket:** When a user has to remove an item from their cart if they don’t want to buy it, which is an extra step that could be easily missed.

An example of sneak into basket is when an extra item is added into a user’s shopping cart while checking out, or an extra plan or service is preselected as “add to my cart” during the checkout process. An easy way to avoid this deceptive pattern in your designs is to make sure no boxes are preselected that add items to a user’s cart. There should not be any surprises about what the user is expecting to purchase.

## What can you do to avoid deceptive patterns?

In your role as a new UX designer, you can help prevent deceptive patterns by being aware of them. That way, when you see a deceptive pattern in action, you’ll be able to correct them. Remember, deceptive patterns are unethical and should be avoided. Being clear and honest with your users will strengthen their trust in your brand and product.
