Oprah Winfrey has created one of the most recognizable personal brands in history. She became a household name by using consistent branding across all of her platforms and products, like the Oprah Winfrey Show, Oprah Radio, and *O* Magazine. Oprah shares inspiring messages with her audience, which has led to real change in people’s lives. Her personal brand lets people know that Oprah’s content will be powerful and uplifting. Just a mention of the name “Oprah” evokes images of honesty and empathy.

## 2. Sarah Cooper

Sarah Cooper is a comedian and author, who also happens to be a former Google employee (and a UXer, at that!). Her website and blog perfectly mirror her sense of humor. All of the photos on Sarah’s website are lighthearted and poke fun at life, just like she does in her comedy skits and TikTok videos. Like Oprah, one of Sarah Cooper’s keys to success is that her personal brand is consistent. Her fun personality shines through all of her content, from the bio on her website, which begins with a quirky “Oh hello, I didn’t see you there,” to a colorful gallery of self-portraits.

Check out Sarah’s satirical blog, The Cooper Review, and compare it to the content on her YouTube channel. Notice how the tone she uses in her headings makes it immediately clear that her content is comedic. Even the language in her upload schedule is playfully written as “new videos every whenever.” What else do you notice about the consistency in her personal brand across these two platforms?

## 3 .Bill Nye

Bill Nye is a scientist and engineer who’s famous for making science fun and engaging. His brand is solidified by his fun theme song for his show, *Bill Nye the Science Guy*. All of his content and television appearances focus on science, but he presents it in a way that’s easy for anyone to understand.

Check out Bill Nye’s [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/BillNye). Notice that he uses puns in his tweets, while still presenting useful facts about science. The voice that he tweets in is consistent with his television personality, and maintains his brand as the “goofy science expert.” His [personal website](https://billnye.com/) uses fun, exaggerated imagery (there’s a floating globe on his homepage!) to keep the atmosphere lighthearted while staying relevant to science.
