# Database

Finally, we have the database model.

The database model is a website structure that mixes a database, or

an organized collection of information, with search functionality.

A database model creates a dynamic experience for

users that includes advanced filtering and search capabilities.

Think about your favorite social media network.

Most social media sites have the ability to post content with tags,

like a location, that categorizes the content.

Users can search for content using these tags.

Or think about the Google Maps website.

When you land on the homepage, the main option you are presented with is

to search the database for an address or a category of locations like restaurants.
