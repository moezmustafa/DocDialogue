# Creating Personas :

Personas are the groups of users  , These groups gives you the data and by using that data you can build cetrain pesudo users : where each represents a fake person that has a defined set of views and hobbies and gender ,

This person can be used as a  center to build around .

## Building personas

Personas are created by conducting user research and identifying common **pain points**, which are UX issues that frustrate and block the user from getting what they need from a product.

As you create personas, look for the most common themes in your data and group the users who personify those themes together. For example, imagine that the data collected from user interviews for the dog walker app shows that a lot of potential users between the ages of 45 and 60 are concerned about dog walkers having access to their homes. That would definitely be a pain point you’d want to include in a persona that represents that specific age group of users.

Generally, creating 3 to 8 personas is enough to represent the majority of a product’s user base. Think of personas as an overview of all of your research and interviews. While it’s important for personas to accurately represent users, it’s impossible to meet every one of their specific needs. Personas are also context-specific, meaning they should be focused on the behaviors and goals of users interacting with the product effectively.

For the dog walker app, think about a scenario from the perspective of a dog owner:

- Daniela is a 48-year-old freelance film producer who lives with their partner Priya and their two children in Atlanta, Georgia. The family recently adopted a golden retriever puppy named Cisco.
- The family takes regular trips with the kids for gymnastics competitions, and Daniela often travels for long periods of time when filming. Daniela wants to find someone to take care of the puppy, Cisco, while the family is away or busy.
- Daniela’s biggest concern is trusting a stranger to come into their home and to take care of their puppy. Daniela would be most comfortable hiring someone who knows how to properly care for puppies and can take Cisco on walks and to dog parks.

Here's what a persona might include for Daniela, using the persona template that was shown in the video:

You can use the information in personas to create designs that speak directly to users, like Daniela. This ensures users have the best experience when using your product! For example, in your designs, you might want to indicate that the dog walkers are screened by the app and must pass background checks, which would reassure users like Daniela that their dog will be safe.

Here’s a pro tip: Get your team's opinion on the product’s users before you build personas. Then, after you build personas, review those suggestions from your team and compare them to the personas you created. Point out how the data validated or contradicted their suggestions. Everyone on your team needs to understand the personas in order to truly connect with your users.

**Fundraising app interviews :** 

you discover that single professionals

in rural areas donate to

environmental causes twice as

often as single professionals in big cities.

You also discover that big city singles are more

likely to volunteer than

single professionals in rural areas.

Based on this, one of your user groups might be

owners of environmental nonprofits in rural areas.

A user group is a set of people who have

similar interests, goals, or concerns.

Now that we've identified a solid user group,

let's build a persona to represent it.

# Activity Exemplar: Creating personas

Here is a completed exemplar along with an explanation of how the exemplar fulfills the expectations for the previous activity.

Below you'll find two examples of created personas. The first persona is the busy junior employee seeking quick and efficient pick-up service. The second persona is the in-store customer who wants to enjoy CoffeeHouse items and its atmosphere in a way that is still favorable to being connected and productive. Both personas are based on aggregated user interviews and represent specific user groups, rather than individual interview participants.

**Persona 1: Anika, ambitious intern:** Busy junior employee seeking quick and efficient pick-up service.

**Persona 2: Ali, remote upskiller:** In-store customer who wants to enjoy CoffeeHouse items and its atmosphere in a way that allows them to be connected and productive.

The exemplar has completed all of the worksheet elements, so you get a sense of who the user is and what drives them. Goals and frustrations are highlighted, as well as a breakdown of the personas' demographics. Lastly, a quote that summarizes their personality is featured at the top, along with a paragraph describing their life at the bottom. The goal is to create a realistic persona to empathize with as you think about the type of design solutions your users might need.

Now compare the exemplars above to your completed self-review. Assess what you’ve done following each of the criteria used to evaluate the exemplars. As you compare, ask yourself:

1. **Demographic information:** Did the demographic information match the persona characteristics given in the activity directions?
2. **Quote:** Were you able to imagine a quote that is relevant to the persona and the background you’ve built for them?
3. **Goals/Frustrations:** Were the goals and frustrations aligned with the persona and the activity scenario?
4. **Brief story/scenario:** Were you able to give more information about the persona, tying in their goals and frustrations, as well as their quote?
5. **Image:** Did you include a picture or avatar representing the personas for your activity?
