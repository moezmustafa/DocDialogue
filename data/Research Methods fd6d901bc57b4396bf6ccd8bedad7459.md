[When to Use Which User-Experience Research Methods](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/)

There are two ways we categorize research methods.

The first way is based on who conducts the research.

The second way is based on the type of data collected.

For example, you might interview users,

survey users, or conduct

a usability study to hear from users directly.

Secondary research is research that uses

information someone else has put together.

Secondary research can be information

from books, articles, or journals

and qualitative research gives you the "why."
