# How Might We "

"How" encourages us to explore a bunch of

ideas instead of moving

forward with only one idea for solution.

The word "how" suggests that we don't have an answer yet.

"Might" emphasizes the open-endedness

of the brainstorming solution.

Our ideas are possible solutions

and not the only solution.

And finally, the word "we"

suggests a collaborative effort.

Ideas that are thorough and

innovative require teamwork to complete.

The question should be specific in

describing the needs of the user,

but still have room for innovation in the final product.

This means that the question is broad enough to

leave space for solutions that might not be evident yet.
