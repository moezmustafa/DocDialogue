Here is a completed exemplar of the desktop version of the digital wireframes for an online clothing store called Tee’s Shirts. The exemplar contains all pages needed to complete the main user flow of selecting and purchasing clothes.

This exemplar is a completed version of the activity you did earlier in the course. Use the exemplar to compare your own work with an example that meets all the criteria. There's also an explanation of how the example fulfills the expectations for the activity that was outlined. The digital wireframes below are based on low-fidelity wireframes that were created earlier.

Here’s how the desktop version of the digital wireframes was created.

**Step 1**: Opening our design program, Adobe XD or Figma.

**Step 2**: Opening a new artboard and then selecting the **Web 1920** size.

**Step 3:**  We dragged or uploaded pictures of our paper wireframes into the design program to use as a guide. Then we specified the layout grid, and then customized the columns, margins and gutter width of the grid.

**Step 4**: Working from the top down and starting with the navigation bar, we filled in the page with different sized rectangles, squares, and circles which will serve as placeholders for visual elements to be added in later. After the navigation bar, we continued to fill in the page with placeholders for the Body section. This step finished with the footer section.

**Step 5**: For text placeholders, we searched the web for lorem ipsum text and then copied and pasted it into the artboard to represent the body text and short phrases for section headings.

**Step 6**: ****Repeating Steps 2 to 5 to build out wireframes for all the other pages of the website.

Now compare your digital wireframes to the matching exemplar above. As you compare, ask yourself:

- Did you use your paper wireframes as a guide?
- Did you create digital wireframes that include every stage of the user flow, starting at the homepage?
- Did you create placeholders (rectangles, squares, and circles) for all the visual elements that will be added in later?
- Did you use lorem ipsum as a placeholder for the body text?
