# Usability Studies :

---

Now that your usability study has been planned in great detail, you’re ready to conduct the study. If you are new to the certificate program and this is your first usability study, or if you’d just like a refresher, you can revisit Course 4 of the Google UX Design Certificate, which is called [Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/home/week/2), and dig into Week 2, which is all about conducting research with usability studies.

In particular, you might want to review these resources from that week of the program:

- This video [explores best practices for starting a usability study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/EJHzj/explore-usability-study-best-practices-before-the-study-begins). If you’re planning to conduct a moderated usability study, this video will help you learn how to build rapport with participants and set up the study for success before you dive into questions.
- This video [explores best practices for communication during the study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/GL33T/explore-usability-study-best-practices-during-the-study), such as asking open-ended questions, asking follow up questions, and summarizing participant responses for confirmation.
- This reading will help you [learn more about usability study best practices](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/supplement/UHzlH/learn-more-about-usability-study-best-practices), including helping participants get comfortable, putting people first, filling out necessary paperwork, communicating clearly, and asking the right questions as the researcher.
- Taking good notes during usability studies is key. Check out this video that [introduces note-taking methods that are commonly used during usability studies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/Mr6jE/introduction-to-note-taking-methods-during-usability-studies), and this video that dives deep into [using a spreadsheet to take notes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/EsxPL/use-a-spreadsheet-to-take-notes). You might also want to utilize the template for spreadsheet note-taking, which contains an empty tab that you can copy for your own study and a completed tab to serve as an example, which is based on the dog walker app from an earlier course of the program.

To use this template, click the link below and select “Use Template.”

You can watch a mock unmoderated usability study, beginning with [this introductory video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/G9MD6/introduction-to-a-mock-unmoderated-usability-study). There are five participants in the mock study: [Participant A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/vCqrV/participant-a-mock-usability-study), [Participant B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/M3j9l/participant-b-mock-usability-study), [Participant C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/BNIS5/participant-c-mock-usability-study), [Participant D](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/LHoKS/participant-d-mock-usability-study), and [Participant E](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/R9ey8/participant-e-mock-usability-study). This example builds throughout Week 2 of the fourth course, if you’d like to learn more.

Everything you need to know in order to successfully conduct a usability study is included in this week from an earlier part of the program, so dig in as much or as little as you need. Good luck with your usability study!
