Design sprints lasts for about a week , this idea can be applied to other things related to learning as well.

As a beginner youll be working on the lower branches of the sprint such as prototyping and taking the interiews.

To recap the five phases of design sprints are:

understand the scope of the design challenge, ideate possible solutions,

decide on the most viable solution, create a workable prototype,

and finally, test that prototype with actual users.

**Planning a Design Sprint :**

Let's recap the sprint planning basics.

To prepare for a design sprint,

you'll need to conduct user research,

schedule talks with experts,

find the right space, gather supplies,

establish ground rules, break the ice with your team,

and plan out post-sprint action items.

Sound about right? Awesome. Let's keep going.

Up next, we'll walk through a design sprint brief.

1. User Research 
2. Call in the Experts 
3. Find the right space
4.  Gather Supplies (stationaries and food items)
5. establish ground rules , such as no gadget zone 
6. breaking the ice
7. post sprint actions

**Sprint retrospective ,** 

The goal is to make sure everyone who took

part in the sprint has a chance to give feedback.

The two key questions we aim

to answer in the meeting are:

What went well? And what can be improved?

The person who led the sprint will guide

the conversation, and someone will take

notes so that the team can use

the feedback to make

the next sprint even more productive.

Speaking of retrospectives, let's recap what we learned.

We now know what a design sprint is,

what's involved in each design sprint phase,

and how to plan a design sprint.

We highlighted where you,

as an entry-level UX designer, fit into

the design sprint process, and

we learned about the importance of sprint retrospectives.

Next up, we'll focus on how to build

a professional presence, but first,

we've got your next assessment.

You've got this and if you need any refreshers,

you can always review. Good luck.
