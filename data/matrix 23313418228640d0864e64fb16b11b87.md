Okay, next up is a matrix model.

The matrix model is a structure that allows users to follow their own path,

since content is linked in several different ways.

Users can navigate to any page and matrix model website and

still be able to access all of the other pages as well.

This allows users to explore the site freely.

Because all the content links to each other,

the matrix model is sometimes referred to as the web model.

Think about the homepage of a news website.

Chances are the website has a navigation menu at the top,

the most recent content front and center on the page, and

then other news stories sorted into linked categories below.

If you click on a news story,

you'll find other related articles linked throughout the article.

For example, if you're reading about a new star in a local zoo, you might find that

a related story about an animal rescue is hyperlinked within the text.

Other articles that might interest you are usually included at the bottom or

to the side of the page too.
