# Learn more about planning a UX research study

---

It’s the moment of truth: You’re preparing to test your low-fidelity prototype with real users! Coming up, you'll gather feedback about your responsive website designs by conducting a usability study.

If you’ve been taking the courses of this certificate program in order, then you’ve already conducted two usability studies for your low-fidelity and high-fidelity mobile app prototypes. You likely remember how to plan a UX research study!

If you’re new to the certificate program or if you’d like a quick refresher, you can review these resources from an earlier course about planning a UX research study:

First, watch this video to [get to know the seven elements of a research plan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/EcQO3/get-to-know-the-seven-elements-of-a-research-plan) at a high level.

Then, check out the following videos and readings that dive into each of the seven elements, and build your own research plan as you go!

- [Project background, research goals, research questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/9OB79/start-building-a-research-plan-project-background-research-goals-and-research). The project background summarizes the situation that led to the need for this research. The research goals lay out what you’re trying to solve with this design or what you’d like the outcomes of the research to be. The research questions are the questions you need the study to answer.
- [Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/VjZEd/continue-building-a-research-plan-kpis). KPIs are the critical measures of progress toward an end goal. If you want to learn more about KPIs, you can check out this reading about how to [use key performance indicators (KPIs)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/supplement/yLaQl/learn-more-about-kpis) as well.
- [Methodology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/GImoc/continue-building-a-research-plan-methodology). The methodology lists the steps you plan to take when conducting the usability study.
- [Participants](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/9b5pa/continue-building-a-research-plan-participants). The participants section describes how and where you'll recruit participants for the usability study. If you want to learn more about participants, check out this reading about [recruiting a diverse participant pool](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/supplement/zR75q/recruit-a-diverse-participant-pool) too.
- [Script](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/cmlaI/finish-building-a-research-plan-script). Your script helps you organize, prepare, and properly phrase interview questions.
