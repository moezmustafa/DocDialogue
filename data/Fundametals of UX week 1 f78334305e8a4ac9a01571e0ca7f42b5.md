WEEK 1 : 

So far, we've discussed why user experience is important,

the job responsibilities of a UX designer

QUERY submission : 

Sites that i think have very strong message are ,

1. https://theyearofgreta.com/

This site is a bit extra , but provides a very clear message and vibe to the whole movement

2.https://www.cappen.com/

As a digital agency this site is really amazing to look at nothing extra just a single page site

3.https://www.codepen.io/

As a site that holds the digital porfolio of programmers it has a very friendly vibe the fonts are nice to look at and the overall useability is decent, all major tools are right in front of you all the time

Sites that i think have  a terrible user experience are :

1.focusmate.com

Site works okay, but lacks some basic feature , for example if you have to view someone's profile youhave to refresh the whole page twice , there is no instant pop up card for the profile , the calender layout look okat but sometimes if you scroll it takes time to re-navigate.

2.pintrest.com

The idea is great but the presentation is really odd to view any image in a high resolution i have to atleast go through 4 steps , and it never tells you at first if an image is downloadable or not .

3.medium.com

This side has to work like a news feed with apt snapshots, from the story rather it has the first few lines and has too much white space that can be used to add certain features like a live counter or reader's stat

Job of a  Ui-UX desinger : 

For example, when you click the File menu

on a word processing application like Google Docs,

you expect certain options, like

New or Print, to appear in the dropdown menu.

Or when you click on a company's homepage,

you expect to find a link to an About page.

That structure is the website's information architecture.
