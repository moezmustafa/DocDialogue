**Mockups** are static, high-fidelity designs used as a representation of a final product. You’ve learned why mockups are important for explaining your designs to stakeholders and your team. You also explored the various factors that go into creating mockups, including visual design elements, methods for arranging these elements, and design principles.

For your final project, it’s important to carefully craft your mockup to paint an entire picture of your product.
