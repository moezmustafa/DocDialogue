# Design Systems and Sticker Sheets

# Learn more about design systems

---

A **design system** is a series of reusable elements and guidelines that allow teams to design and develop a product, following predetermined standards. Design systems include all kinds of elements from color palettes to icons to buttons. Design systems create consistency for both designers and users, and make designing faster and easier. As you create mockups, you might develop your own design system or utilize an existing design system.

To learn more about using design systems in mockups, review this video that provides an [introduction to design systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/item/Y8IFm) and this video about [the benefits of design systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/nhIQi/benefits-of-design-systems) from an earlier course of the certificate program.

## Develop your own design system

If you’re designing in Figma, you can create a simple design system called a sticker sheet. A **sticker sheet** is a frame within Figma where you save colors and components that you can copy-and-paste into designs. Revisit this video from earlier in the certificate program if you’d like to learn more about [creating a sticker sheet in Figma](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/Q36KK/create-a-sticker-sheet-in-figma).

If you’re designing in Adobe XD, you can use the **Assets Panel** to save colors, character styles, and components to develop your own small-scale design system. Review this video from the previous course of the certificate program if you’d like to learn more about [using the Assets Panel in Adobe XD](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/lecture/JNcjj/start-creating-mockups-for-a-website-homepage-in-adobe-xd) (starting at 3:36).

## Utilize an existing design system

As a UX designer, you’ll utilize design systems all the time to improve the speed and consistency of your work. Especially when you’re new to the field, design systems can help you get a feel for best practices in design and can improve the quality of your work. Explore popular design systems, like the ones linked below, and take note of design elements or components that you might want to leverage in your own designs:
