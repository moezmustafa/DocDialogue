# Attention Economy

As a UX designer, the product you create will constantly compete for users’ attention. If users are paying attention to one thing, like a notification on their mobile phone, it means they’re ignoring something else. There are only 24 hours in a day, so users have to be selective about how they spend that time! This battle over users’ attention is referred to as the **attention economy**.

The term attention economy originated with psychologist and Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon, who believed that there are limits on what humans can think about and do at one time. Many scientists believe that humans aren’t very good multitaskers; technology should help users, not distract them. The more distracted a person is, the less likely they are to complete a task well.

The clash between attention and distraction is why UX designers need to consider how the products they design will affect a person’s behavior. Simon once said, “A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.” In your role as a new UX designer, it’s important that technology improves the lives of your users and doesn’t harm them. Designers need to make sure they don’t design their products in a way that encourages addictive behaviors that could negatively affect users’ lives.

On the left, they are greyscale and have their eye closed, and have icons to the left such as a checklist, a house, a stationary bike, a calendar, a baby. On the right, they are more colorful and have an eye open. To the right of them, there are icons like a video game controller, text message conversation, a laptop, a phone with various app notifications

The concept of the attention economy also explains how interacting with technology may cause depression or anxiety for some. For example, a user may feel sad when they don’t hear or see new notifications on their phone, or they may experience the fear of missing out (also known as FOMO) if they don’t continually refresh their social media feed or check their messages. Even seemingly small details, like the colors used and the volume of notifications, can be distracting to users or cause them to feel anxious.

Technology makes many things faster and easier, but it shouldn’t control people’s lives. Recently, companies have started to understand the psychological impact of technology and are updating their designs to help users stay away from the pitfalls of the attention economy. For example, at Google, the [Digital Wellbeing toolkit](https://wellbeing.google/) helps users better manage how they use their phones and the amount of time spent on them.
