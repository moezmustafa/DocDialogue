# Present a competitive audit

---

You’ve researched the direct and indirect competitors of the product you're designing, and you’ve compiled all of your findings into a spreadsheet. Now it’s time to turn the information in your spreadsheet into a presentation for your team or client.

You can present the detailed findings of your competitive audit as a report in a document or as a presentation, using software like Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, or Apple’s Keynote. In this reading, you’ll learn some best practices for organizing and presenting the results of your competitive audit. Here we go!

## Tips for your slides

Beginning your presentation by introducing the goals of your competitive audit is always a good idea. This lets your audience know exactly what you're trying to learn about the competition, as well as the purpose of your presentation. You should address the objectives of your audit, the research questions you wanted to answer, and the features or characteristics you compared while auditing competitors. Here's an example of a slide that could be used to start a competitive audit presentation:

Slide that shows goals and methods, broken into Objective, Research Questions, and Procedure.
Objective: Burger Garden says their clients have lost interest in their product. We audited industry competitors to understand how the BG app compares.
Research Questions: Are they attracting the right audience that they say they are speaking to? How does their app look and feel? Does the design complement the product? Will the user get confused as they navigate through the app?
Procedure: We reviewed these aspects of each restaurant and their app or website design: Audience, First Thoughts, User Interaction, Visual Design, and Content.

To help organize your information and keep the presentation flowing smoothly, each section of your presentation should have a section header that communicates what the section is about. The section header usually has a solid color background and a clear word or phrase that describes the upcoming information, like this:

Next, summarize what you learned about your competitors’ products. It’s important to point out the areas where your product is excelling, as well as areas where you want to improve your product or design. This helps everyone understand where your product stands in comparison to competitors.

As you organize the information from your competitive audit, think about how to effectively present your insights. Your presentation’s overall visual design should use your company’s branding style and color scheme. You also want to keep your work as simple and clean as possible. Remove cluttered and confusing imagery to make it easier for your audience to follow the presentation and focus on the important information. In this example, the most important information is highlighted in the screenshots and explained in the section to the left, which makes the slide easier to follow:

Visual presentation of competitive audit findings for Burger Garden located in Kansas City, Missouri. On the left of the presentation slide, text shows the cost of burgers (around $10 each), the business size (small), the audience (millennials), the unique value prop (large variety of burgers and toppings), and the initial findings (clear branding identified in screenshot A, content ton is inconsistent in screenshot B).
On the right side of the slides are two screenshots. Screenshot A shows the company name is clearly displayed at the top of their website. Screenshot B shows text on the website that reads "Each ingredient implemented into our burgers is of the highest grade and viscosity, assembled with diligence and care for your family unit."

It’s essential to include a summary of key points from your audit at the end of the presentation. As you learned earlier, competitive audits can compare up to 10 companies. That’s a lot of information for your audience to take in! A summary can refresh your audience’s memories and recap the most important information.

## Information presentation

The methods you use to present your data can influence the way that your data is interpreted. The type of data you’re sharing can help you decide the best method for sharing it.

For example, if you have a lot of numbers and quantitative data to share, it’s probably a good idea to present that data in a graph. Graphs are effective at showing how numbers compare to one another and help your audience process what you’re presenting quickly.

If you want to demonstrate a specific functionality or issue with a competitor’s product, consider including a screen recording in your presentation. A **screen recording** is made by taking a video of your screen as you navigate an app or website. You can also pull up the competitor’s app or website during your live presentation, but there’s a chance that the product won’t function in the same way as it did before or that spotty internet access could cause technical issues.

Finally, to make the information that you're presenting clear, it's often helpful to create a rubric that explains the grading system used in your audit. The rubric system used in the example audit graded the burger restaurants from “needs work” to “outstanding.” Using that rubric, each restaurant was rated on a scale of one to four in each category to create a final rating.

## Delivering a strong presentation

Now that you know the kinds of information to include in your presentation, you might need some pointers on the actual presentation process. Here are a few tips to keep in mind while you prepare to present:

- **Get a peer review from the team**. Before your presentation, share your report or slides with a trusted teammate to get their take on how the information flows.
- **Limit the amount of words on slides**. You need just enough information to draw attention to important points. Save the details for your speech.
- **Use notes.** Flashcards or “speaker's notes” can help you stay focused, on topic, and on time.
- **Practice** **ahead of time.** Do a few trial runs before the big day so that you get comfortable with the layout and pace of your presentation.
- **Use relevant graphics.** Make sure any images and graphics you use relate directly to the topic you’re presenting about. When done well, images can really enhance your presentation and engage the audience. But when done poorly, images can cause confusion. Think carefully about the images and graphics you include!
- **Stick to the highlights.** A presentation to your team or client should only focus on the highlights of your audit. If you want to get into specific details, add them to the appendix of your presentation or create a written report.
- **Keep your biases in check.** Marking down an app that uses red in its design because you don’t like that shade of red isn’t a good enough reason to give that app a bad grade. Be aware of your own design biases and try to prevent them from clouding your judgment during the audit or the presentation.
- **Be able to defend your data.** If you reach a conclusion in your audit, make sure you have the evidence to back it up. You need to be able to justify every conclusion you reach with actual data and specific examples.

Presenting your research can seem intimidating, but remember that you are representing your user! Competitive audits give you, your team, and your clients knowledge that will help create well-rounded, valuable product designs that work.
