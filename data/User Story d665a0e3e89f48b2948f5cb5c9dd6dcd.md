Here are two completed examples of user stories, along with an explanation of how these examples fulfill the expectations for the activity.

### **User story one:**

Anika is a marketing intern at a midsized advertising firm. Twice a week, they collect 6-12 coffees from a nearby coffee shop for their team before their morning meeting. But sometimes they arrive to find that their order is incomplete or has become cold from waiting too long for them to pick it up. They need status notifications between the time they place their order and the time they pick it up so that they can better plan their arrival for pick-up.

**Anika’s user story:**

As a marketing intern who collects coffee orders for my team, I want to submit and monitor my orders through the app so that I can better time my arrival and minimize my waiting time.

### **User story two**

Ali is a line cook who lives in a small city and mostly works in the evenings. During the daytime, Ali does an online coding boot camp for 3-4 hours to learn a new employable skill. They usually do the boot camp from local coffee shops, but sometimes get frustrated at the limited seating, which they might lose if they leave to place a new coffee or food order. Ali could use the CoffeeShop app to reserve an in-shop workspace and, while they’re there, could place their CoffeeShop order through the app.

**Ali's user story:**

As a remote student who spends 3-4 hours a day studying and purchasing products, I want to be able to order without getting up and potentially losing my table so that I can enjoy CoffeeHouse products and continue to work.

In the exemplar, note that each question (who, what, and why) is answered for each persona. Anika and Ali both have one-sentence user stories to help prioritize design goals by the end of the exercise.

Now compare the examples above to your completed user stories. Assess what you’ve done using each of the criteria below to evaluate the examples. 

Does your user story clearly identify the:

- Type of user?
- The “action” that the user hopes will happen?
- The “benefit” the user would receive if the action happens?

If so, great work! If not, reread the instructions and craft another user story with these criteria in mind.
