# sequential

The second common website structure is sequential.

A sequential model is a website structure that leads users

through a step-by-step process.

Sequential websites order their pages from a starting page to an end point,

sort of in a line.

Users start on the site's first page and click a link or

button to go to the next page in the order.

Users continue this pattern,

clicking through the pages in order until they've reached the last page.

In a true sequential structure, like an online survey,

users aren't able to navigate to pages out of order.

They can navigate between the next, and previous page but

they aren't able to skip over pages or go to a home page.

So think of this: Have you ever tried to find car insurance online?

Almost all insurance sites are sequential forms to get a quote.

The purpose of each page in a website

that uses a sequential structure is to get users to the next step in the sequence,

moving them toward an end goal.
