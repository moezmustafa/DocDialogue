You’ve spent a lot of time learning who your user is and how empathy and user research can help you improve your understanding of your users' needs. In this reading, you’ll learn how to use that knowledge to create hypothesis statements.

## Implementing what you’ve learned so far

Take a moment to review what you’ve learned so far.

**Empathizing** with users allows you to consider the experience from the users’ perspectives and discover their likes, dislikes, and pain points.

**Defining** involves sorting through the user research you collected during the empathize phase. Analyzing that user research helps you create a problem statement.

Once you’ve analyzed your research and understand your users’ problems, you can begin coming up with solutions. That’s where you’re at in the design process now! You’re ready to create **hypothesis statements**.

## Creating hypothesis statements

A **hypothesis statement** is an educated guess about what you think the solution to a design problem might be. You know your user’s problems, so it’s time to problem solve and consider solutions.

Hypothesis statements don’t have a standard formula, but there are two common methods for building them. First, you can use an “if / then” statement to come up with a hypothesis.

Here are some examples of if/then hypothesis statements applied to the users of the dog walker app:

- **If** Arnold downloads the dog walker app, **then** they can utilize the “simplified” mode setting to view only the basic app functions.
- **If** Tobias signs up for the dog walker app, **then** they will quickly and easily pick a walker that fits their schedule.

The second common method for building hypothesis statements is “**we believe” statements.**

- **We believe that** a simplified mode of the dog walker app **for** Arnold **will** allow them to hire dog walkers efficiently.
- **We believe that** easy access to available dog walkers **for** Tobias **will** increase the amount of walks they choose for their pets.

“If/then” statements focus directly on the needs of your users. “We believe” statements take the perspective of your team into account, while remaining empathetic to the needs of your users.

You might encounter situations where you have multiple hypothesis statements for one problem statement. That’s okay! There will always be multiple solutions for your users’ problems. Your job as a UX designer is to use your creativity and problem-solving skills to decide which solutions work best for the unique users you’re designing for.
