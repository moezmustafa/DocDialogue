# Explore types of gestures and motion

As technology evolves, designers improve the types of shortcuts available to get users so they get what they need faster.  Users expect to be able to use the same gestures and motions across different products. That's why gestures and motions have become more and more important in UX and UI.

## Gestures

**Gestures** are any method of interaction a user has with information on their device using touch. A few common gestures that you can use as a UX designer are:

- **Swipe.** A swipe is a brief brushing of the screen with a fingertip horizontally or vertically. A swipe can be used to move from one screen of an app to another. It can also be used to interact with a carousel of content.
- **Tap.** A tap is a brief touch of the screen by the user (not to be confused with a longer “press” or “touch and hold”). Taps can be customized from the use of one fingertip to four fingertips. Single-finger tapping is often used to select an item on the screen. Two-finger tapping is often used as a shortcut to make the context menu (also known as the right-click menu) appear.
- **Scroll and pan.** The scroll and pan gesture allows users to slide their fingers vertically, horizontally, and omnidirectionally through a page’s content. Scroll and pan works well for interactive features like maps or large collections of content like a gallery of images.
- **Drag.** The drag gesture provides users the ability to slide across the surface of a device to move it in and out of view. Drag is often used for the main notification menu on mobile devices.
- **Pinch.** Using two fingers simultaneously, a pinch is the movement of fingers closing into each other or moving away from one another. A pinch allows users to scale items on a screen like changing the size of a website. It is also used to zoom in and out of maps and photos.

While some of these gestures may seem familiar, they aren't always universal across all devices or operating systems. For example, the scroll and pan gesture on a mobile device doesn’t have the same function on a laptop touchpad. An Apple or an Android phone might assign different functionality to a gesture as well. When you include gestures in your devices, it's good practice to look at how other products use these gestures so you can design accessible, familiar products for your users.

## Gestures and operating systems

As phones have changed and evolved, operating systems have become more characteristic to manufacturers. Have you ever borrowed a friend’s phone and found yourself lost on how to use a different operating system? The simple task of taking a photo can become complicated when you don’t know which gesture opens a phone’s menu.

This is because there is a difference in the design philosophy for gestures between Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. More specifically, iOS is based on the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/), or HIG for short, while Android is based on [Material Design](https://material.io/).

HIG and Material Design provide designers and developers with guidelines and standards for the gestures, patterns, and icons used for their particular operating system. As designers, it’s our job to understand these guidelines so we can create designs for our users that can be implemented by our team. These designs also need to meet user’s expectations to improve user interaction with your product. And testing your designs on various devices is always a good practice.

Let’s check out some real-world examples of gestures that some operating systems use:

### **Undo text**

On an Apple iOS device, a three-finger swipe while typing text allows the user to undo and redo any of the typed text they’ve just written. This is a quick way to edit text in a fast-moving conversation.

To perform this action on an Android device, users manually delete the line of text, or tap and hold the text to select it and press the delete key.

### **Screenshot**

On an Apple iOS device, the user would have to use a button combination, like pressing the side button and the up button simultaneously, to take a screenshot.

On an Android device, horizontally swiping your palm across the screen will take a screenshot of what is currently visible on the device.

### **Copy and paste text**

On an Apple iOS device, using three fingers to simultaneously pinch on the screen allows users to quickly copy and paste selected text.

Android users, in comparison, can tap with two fingers to call the context menu so they can select the copy or paste function.

## Applying gestures to your designs

Getting to know how operating systems work will help you as you design your mobile apps. For example, if you design a mobile game that relies heavily on users being able to press their back button quickly, Apple device users may have a hard time interacting with your design.

You also want to be sure that your design doesn’t use a common gesture in a different manner. For example, if your app design switches the back button to the left side instead of the right, users might be confused about how to exit the screen.

Accessibility is also important to keep in mind as you think about how you design your gesture use. Both Apple and Google suggest that the gestures you use in your design don’t replace basic interface navigation used by the operating system.

## Motion

Motion refers to the way that the screen reacts to gestures across the screen. In lots of ways, motion responds to the requests a user is making. The right kind of motion can guide the user’s attention to a particular focal point in your app, like showing the pages of a menu moving in response to a scroll or seeing a menu disappear as you drag it closed. This provides users with a more rewarding experience as they interact with an app.

Let’s check out an example of motion you might be familiar with if you have a smartphone. When using an Apple iOS device, a long-press on an app icon causes all the apps on the home screen to enter “jiggle mode,” where the app icons shake and a minus symbol appears on each in the left-hand corner. As shown in the image on the left, this motion lets the user know they are able to edit all of the apps.

When using an Android device, the motion is much more subtle. By pressing and holding an app icon on the home screen, a menu of options appears for that app only. The app icon bounces slightly up and down as a reminder of which app’s settings are being accessed by the user, as shown in the image on the right. These are examples of how motion can help users interact with and understand operating systems.

Good motion design feels natural and easy for the user. Have you ever been in the middle of using a device and the motion suddenly starts to move slowly and become less responsive? That frustration is exactly what we want to avoid with our designs. Functional motion is key to creating great usability in UX.
