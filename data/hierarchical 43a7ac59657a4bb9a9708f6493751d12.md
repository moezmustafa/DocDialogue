# hierarchical

The first page of a hierarchical website is the homepage, where users start.

This is represented by the page 1 at the top of a tree.

The next level contains pages for the main categories of content.

On a website,

these categories usually appear in a navigation bar at the top of the homepage.

This is represented by pages 2, 3, and 4 in the diagram.

Often when you hover your mouse over one of the categories in the navigation bar or

click on that category,

a list of additional pages within that category appears.

Each of these pages is considered a child of the parent category.

For example, Page 5 and Page 6 are considered child pages of Page 2.

Hbo.com is a good example of the hierarchical model.

The website homepage offers main categories like series, movies, and

docs at the parent level across the top of the homepage.

If I click on one of the category pages like "series," the site offers

sub-category pages at the child level, like featured series, specials, and sports.

You might have guessed that the hierarchical model gets

this name from the word hierarchy.

In UX design, hierarchy means organizing your content by importance.
