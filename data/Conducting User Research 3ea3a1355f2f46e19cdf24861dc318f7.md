# Conducting User Research

With a well-crafted introduction and primary research questions, your UX research study plan will have a strong base you can use to build the rest of your plan. The introduction and primary research questions will help your design team:

- Establish research goals
- Identify who’s affected by the design
- Define research deliverables
- Ensure research data quality

Here is a completed exemplar along with an explanation of how the exemplar fulfills the expectations for the previous activity.

This is an exemplar using the CoffeeHouse scenario you have been following in this and other courses. The example includes a UX research study plan introduction and primary research questions. The other parts of the research plan will be completed in a future activity.

In this exemplar, the UX research study plan clearly identifies each key element of a plan introduction:

- **Title**: The focus and reason for the study.
- **Author**: Researcher’s name, title, and email address.
- **Stakeholders**: Group targeted for testing, and the names and titles of key people at the company who oversee app changes and operations.
- **Date**: When the plan was last updated.
- **Project background**: A brief explanation of why the CoffeeHouse app is being updated and what is being tested with users.
- **Research goals**: What we’d like to learn from testing the CoffeeHouse app update, and how our research results might affect our design decisions.

With the introduction details clearly defined, the primary research questions could be written based on those details. The questions are:

- Actionable. The question answers will enable the researchers to provide actionable feedback to the design team.
- Specific instead of broad, and can produce meaningful data.
- Neutrally phrased and not leading. None of the questions favor one specific answer choice.
- Express whether the research method should be quantitative or qualitative. one question is quantitative and can be measured. One question is qualitative, and offers opportunities to learn users’ feelings and other insights about the app update that are hard to measure.

Now compare the exemplar above to your completed deliverable. Assess what you’ve done using each of the criteria used here to evaluate the exemplar.

Have you constructed a UX research study plan introduction that:

- Has a **title** that represents the focus and reason for the study?
- Lists the name, title, and email address for the **author** of the plan?
- Identifies the study’s **stakeholders**, including any groups targeted for testing and people at the company whose work might be affected by the study?
- Has the **date** that the plan was last updated?
- Includes a brief explanation of the **project background** that communicates the reason for the study and what is being tested?
- Outlines **research goals** that demonstrate what you’d like to learn from the study, and how your research results might affect your design decisions?

From your problem statement were you able to formulate corresponding primary research questions that are:

- Actionable and can clearly be answered by your research?
- Specific to make sure your study produces meaningful data?
- Neutrally phrased and not leading, so users aren’t guided towards providing certain answers?
- Clear on whether quantitative or qualitative data is being collected?
