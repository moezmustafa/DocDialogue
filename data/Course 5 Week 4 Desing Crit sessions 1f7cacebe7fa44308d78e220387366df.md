Date: June 1, 2021
Tags: course 5 week 4

This part of the course was literally the slowest among and its the slow and the lazy pace that made me delay it for so long (approx 12 days , Yikes!)

well the course talks about the core concepts of conducting the reviews for the design sessions and that can be done through the classification of the team members into a task based force that carry out a planned , divide and conquer type approach to investigate the lacking areas about the already exiting desing and the user input to better improve the design .

WebAim will let us know that a certain color set is according to the guidelines of WCAG or not

Now that you’ve learned the basics of how to incorporate gestures and motion into your designs, it’s time to dig deeper. When it comes to prototyping, there are many triggers, animations, and interactions that can enhance your designs. The way you use each of these techniques will depend on the goals for your product.
