# Journey Maping  :

## A **user journey** is the series of experiences

a user has as they interact with your product.

User journeys build off the

personas and stories you've already created.

They help you think and feel like the user,

which is super important.

If you can't put yourself in the user's shoes,

you can't be sure your design will really help them.

Before you start the user journey,

you need a journey map.

A journey map is just what it sounds like.

An illustration of what the user

goes through to achieve their goals.

Think of reading a book.

If the persona is your character,

the user story is your plot,

and the journey map is your story outline.

## HOW IT EFFECTS :

Now that you've planned and prepared for

happy paths and edge cases,

let's discover what user journeys are all about.

### **An Example :**

Creating a journey map lets you thoroughly

detail the user's interaction with your design.

That way you can really focus on how a specific persona,

not you, thinks and feels at every step.

Journey mapping also highlights new pain points.

For example, say your persona Kindred is biracial.

Her user journey is filling out her census info online.

Everything's going well until it's time for

Kindred to select her race from the drop-down menu.

Suddenly she hits a roadblock.

There's no option for her to identify

herself as both Black and Korean.

That's a pain point.

If you yourself aren't biracial,

you might not have predicted this problem.

But by creating the persona of Kindred, giving her a story,

and mapping out her journey,

you're able to clearly

identify the issue and correct it.

Which brings us to the final

key benefit of journey mapping:

Identify improvement opportunities.

In Kindred's example, you could add an option in

the menu for users to write in their racial identity.

Or maybe you could add another field to

the drop-down menu for multiracial citizens.

Improving the UX here can make a big difference.

So how do we map out a user journey? One action at a time.
