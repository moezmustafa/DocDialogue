# Applying for a job as UX designer :

Many people who are new to the field

of UX design probably can't

explain the difference between

wireframes and prototypes, but you can.

This is something to highlight in your resume.

That's my first pro tip:

Use key terms from job descriptions in your resume.

If a company expects you to build prototypes,

you'll want to emphasize that you understand what this

means and showcase

your previous experience with prototypes.

Keep in mind, key terms might also include soft skills,

like collaboration,

presenting findings, or working remotely.
