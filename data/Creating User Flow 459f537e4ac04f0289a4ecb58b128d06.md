# Creating User Flow :

## Draw a user flow

UX designers often outline user flows with common shapes: circles, rectangles, diamonds, and lines with arrows. Each shape represents an interaction the user will have with the product you're designing. Assigning a different shape to each interaction makes the user flow clear to anyone on the team involved in creating the product.

**Action:** The actions users take when moving through a product design are represented as circles. In other words, circles show steps that must be taken to complete a task from start to finish. For the user flow of a dog walker app, actions might include opening the app, clicking on a dog walkerâ€™s profile, and booking a dog walker.

**Screen:** The screens of a digital product that users will experience while completing tasks are represented as rectangles. For the user flow of a dog walker app, screens might include a homepage or a booking confirmation page.

**Decision:** Diamonds represent points in the user flow where users must ask a question and make a decision. The decision users make will either move them forward through the flow or back to an earlier part of the flow. For the user flow of a dog walker app, a decision could be choosing whether or not to book the dog walker whose profile is being reviewed.

**User flow direction**: Lines with arrows tie everything together and display the flow of information. Solid lines indicate forward direction through the user flow, and the dotted lines indicate backward direction or returning to a previous page.

## EXAMPLER :

Here is a completed user flow for the CoffeeHouse app, along with an explanation of how this exemplar fulfills the expectations for the activity.

Self assess the user flow you created in the activity, using each of the criteria below.

The exemplar user flow provides:

- A clear and easy flow for users to get from the entry point of opening the app, to task completion of an order confirmation.
- Clearly labeled steps that are each represented by the appropriate shape.
- Lines with arrows connecting all the steps of the user flow.
