Empathize,  Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test

Empathize: A graphic of two people relating to one another. 
Define: A graphic of a bullseye 
Ideate: A graphic or several people creating ideas together
Prototype: A mobile mockup on a computer screen. 
Test: several people providing feedback about a device.

**Empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.** Those are the five phases of the design process that you’ve followed throughout this certificate program. As you start to design a responsive website focused on the project prompt you selected, you’re going to begin the design process from the beginning: empathize.

Remember, **empathy** is the ability to understand someone else’s feelings or thoughts in a situation. You need to identify and understand the needs, experiences, and perspectives of the users you’re designing for.

- You’ll create **empathy maps**, based on interviews you conduct, which highlight what a user or group of users *says*, *does*, *thinks*, and *feels*.
- You’ll craft **personas**, which are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users.
- You’ll develop **user stories**, which are stories told from the persona’s unique perspective. User stories include three parts: a *who* (type of user), a *what* (the desired action), and a *why* (the benefit for the user).
- You’ll build **user journey maps,** which are visual representations of the actions a user takes to achieve a goal.

Together, these four tools can offer insight into the psychology of users and help UX designers, like you, better empathize with real people who might use the product you're designing.

To learn more about empathizing with users, review the first half of this video about [empathizing with users](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/lecture/whg0R/build-an-empathy-map) and this video about [identifying user pain points](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/lecture/MN05j/identify-user-pain-points) from earlier in the certificate program. You can also revisit this reading about [understanding empathy in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/supplement/hMyDG/understand-empathy-in-ux-design).

If you need a refresher on the five phases of the design process before you begin, check out this video about [key frameworks in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design/lecture/8SoMF/key-frameworks-in-ux-design) (beginning at 2:32) from the first course of the certificate program. Or, review this reading about [thinking like a designer](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design/supplement/aJY8z/think-like-a-designer-user-centered-design-5-elements-of-ux-design-design) and scroll down to the “Design thinking process” header.
