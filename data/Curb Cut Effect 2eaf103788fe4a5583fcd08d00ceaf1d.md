# Curb Cut Effect

**The curb-cut effect is a phenomenon that describes how**

**products and policies designed for people with**

**disabilities often end up helping everyone.**

Or consider this: If you've ever broken your leg,

you know how challenging it can be to do everyday things,

like go down a flight of stairs.

When you design features for someone with

a permanent limited mobility, like elevators,

power lifts, or wide aisles to accommodate wheelchairs,

you'll end up helping an even broader range of users.

Similarly, if you're a sighted person who has tried

to watch a breaking news story on TV in a noisy bar,

chances are you've been helped out by closed captioning.

You don't have to hear

the news anchor as long as you can read what they're

saying. And since closed captioning is multilingual,

users who aren't fluent in the language being spoken can

understand what's being said by

reading closed captioning in their native language.
