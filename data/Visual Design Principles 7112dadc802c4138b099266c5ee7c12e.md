Emphasis: One large circle at the top and three small circles below it. 
Hierarchy: Shows the top lines as the largest and brightest and most important and the lines that follow become less and less important.
Scale: Shows two of the same yellow circles, the circle to the left is large and the circle to the right is scaled down.
Proportion: Three green circles, large, medium, and small that get smaller at the same proportions. 
Unity: Several small circles organized together that they show the shape of a four-sided star. 
Variety: Several different shapes in the same size and color.

In the previous course of the certificate program, when you created mobile app designs in Figma, you refined and improved your mockups using visual design principles like emphasis, hierarchy, scale and proportion, and unity and variety.

If any of these terms are unfamiliar, we recommend that you return to the previous course of the program and complete Week 2, which is all about [applying visual design principles to mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/home/week/2).

Or, if want a quick refresher about these visual design principles, check out these videos and readings from the previous course of the program:

- Revisit this video about [emphasis in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/UBr71/emphasis-in-ux-design) and this reading about [using emphasis in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/nFGif/use-emphasis-in-your-mockups).
- Revisit this video about [hierarchy in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/KbxZ6/hierarchy-in-ux-design) and this reading about [using hierarchy in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/RkKU2/use-hierarchy-in-your-mockups).
- Revisit this video about [scale and proportion ****in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/ic8uL/scale-and-proportion-in-ux-design) and this reading about [using scale and proportion in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/TAY3N/use-scale-and-proportion-in-your-mockups).
- Revisit this video about [unity and variety in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/BjGtw/unity-and-variety-in-ux-design) and this reading about [using unity and variety in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/wgX84/use-unity-and-variety-in-your-mockups).
- If you want to take your mockups one step further, you should also consider reviewing this video about [applying Gestalt Principles to mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/BCy9Z/apply-gestalt-principles-to-mockups) and this reading that [introduces additional Gestalt Principles](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/lfeh2/learn-about-additional-gestalt-principles).
