Thierry's first action is to find a recipe. The task list for that action is to read a blog, plan timing, and determine price of ingredients. Their feelings for that action are delighted to set aside time to cook and feeling nervous about expensive items. The improvement opportunity here is recipe recommendations based off what they already have available. 

Thierry's second action is to buy groceries. The task list for that action is to go to the store, find fresh ingredients, and checkout. Their feelings for that action are excited to be at the store, and feeling confused by the variety and number of options. The improvement opportunity here is and ingredient encyclopedia that estimates how long food will last at home. 

Thierry's third action is to prepare a meal. The task list for that action is to chop vegetables, find the recipe again, and eat. Their feelings for that action are frustrated that it's later than expected, and happy that the food tastes good. The improvement opportunity here is a reminder system to cook simpler recipes as the timer goes down. 

Thierry's fourth action is to save leftovers. The task list for that action is to go to the pack leftovers, pack fresh ingredients, and put everything away in the fridge. Their feelings for that action are surprised by the amount of food left, and concern about storing vegetables. The improvement opportunity here is suggestions on what to cook with leftovers. 

Thierry's fifth action is to clean the fridge. The task list for that action is to find leftovers and ingredients, throw away anything spoiled, and clean up the mess. Their feelings for that action are feeling disgusted by the mess, and frustrated at having to throw food away. The improvement opportunities here are a log of what gets thrown away, and sharing leftovers with neighbors.

In the example above, the journey map is specifically meeting the criteria of a successful journey map. It defines the actions that Thierry takes to accomplish their goal, from finding a recipe to cleaning the fridge out later. Each specific action is broken down into a set of smaller tasks like chopping vegetables as a task in the “Prepare Meal” action. The way Thierry feels about each action is included and broken down into multiple emotions where applicable. Instances where the journey can be improved are pulled out as items that can help generate ideas for the product as the designer moves forward.

The designer’s other persona, Cam, is a wheelchair user. In the journey map for that persona, special consideration is paid to the improvement opportunities for Cam. For instance, the designer knows that Cam pays particular attention to the layout of their favorite grocery stores. This insight is built into the improvement opportunities in that journey map.

Finally, the bias of the designer is acknowledged and reduced by relying solely on the research that’s been done so far. This is not a journey map representing the needs of the designer; it’s a journey map for the personas who would potentially need the product.

Now compare the exemplar above to your completed user journey maps. Assess what you’ve done by comparing your work to the exemplar. Do your user journey maps meet the criteria outlined above? If not, re-read the instructions and amend your user journey maps with these criteria in mind.
