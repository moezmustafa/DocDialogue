# Information Architecture :

It’s important for UX designers to understand **information architecture (IA)**, which organizes content to help users understand where they are in a product and where the information they want is. Information architecture is the roadmap for users to get everything they need from the product you’re designing.

Information architecture is all about organizing the contents of your designs for excellent user flow. IA requires you to know the users you’re designing for and their goals, behaviors, and expectations about products like yours.

To learn more about IA, review this video about [the basics of information architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/wireframes-low-fidelity-prototypes/lecture/Ch0qf/the-basics-of-information-architecture-ia) from earlier in the certificate program. Then, check out this guide from Adobe XD called [The Beginner’s Guide to Information Architecture in UX](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/information-architecture/introductory-guide-to-information-architecture/) or this article from UX Planet about [the basics of IA for designers](https://uxplanet.org/information-architecture-basics-for-designers-b5d43df62e20).

First, IA can organize

and define the structure for your website.

An organized website is easy to navigate.

Also, IA can provide a high-level view of a product.

Understanding how the elements for a website fit

together and relate to each

other can improve your design process.

In addition, IA helps stakeholders review your designs.

Stakeholders can evaluate whether the content in

the site or the app is the correct type of content,

and if it's placed in the appropriate places to

help achieve business or product goals.

Next, IA can help engineers

understand how to organize the data.

The eventual development of the product

matches the visual designs you've created.

Not only will your users benefit from good IA,

it will make your colleagues' jobs easier too.

In addition, messy IA can

add time to the web development process,

and you don't always have time to spare.
